🛠️ This is a repo for common tools, scripts, etc that I use at work and at home 🏡

My config files live here when they're not crashing my terminal

Install with:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobinsmit/dotfiles/main/.dotfiles/install.sh)"
```

Tobin can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 😉
